# ðŸŽ… Advent of Code 2024 in Lua: The Modder's Edition ðŸŽ„


## ðŸŒŸ Why Lua?

1. Because **real programmers** don't need types. (Or at least that's what we tell ourselves while debugging.)
2. It's small, it's fast, and it's portable. You can run Lua on a microwave if you try hard enough.
3. Modders rule the world. (And so does Lua, in everything from Minecraft to Factorio.)
